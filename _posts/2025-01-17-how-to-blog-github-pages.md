## How to Host a Blog on GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is awesome. It is a space where developers (or anyone) can have a web presence for free. It's not quite as fancy pants as a WYSIWYG site builder like Squarespace but it is free of charge.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) easy to setup if you are already a GitHub user. It does not support blogging right out of the box which is a bummer but there are still ways to do it. GitHub provides a repo and steps on [how to setup a blog](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) which is probably the most common way to do it. However, it just seemed like a lot of steps and required learning a bit about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which did not interest me.

After a failry short search I found [Chad Baldwin's](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) blog post on how to setup a blog on GitHub Pages. Chad has created a template repo with everything you need to setup a blog on GitHub Pages. The title of his blog post literally states that a blog can be setup in minutes and that is exactly right. I followed his instructions and had a blog post published in no time.

Special thanks to [Chad Baldwin](https://chadbaldwin.net/) for providing this super easy GitHub Pages blog template.
